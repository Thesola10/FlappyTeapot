# Flappy Teapot

So you see, I had this _silly_ idea for an HTTP 418 page, and then this happened.

## Build
1) Enable `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
2) Install `wasm-pack`
3) Build using `wasm-pack build`
4) Create the Webpack using `Â«ebpack` CLI (NPM or Yarn)
5) Start a web server at the root of the repo and access `demo.html`
